# Simple Media Downloader

Simple Media Downloader (3rd Generation)

This is the third full rewrite of Simple Multimedia Downloader.

The first version of SMD is working but hard to maintain.
In the secord generation/version of SMD, there is a design flaw
that cannot be fixed.
In this third generation of Simple ~~Multi~~Media Downloader,
we will try to fix those issues present in the past SMD generations.
